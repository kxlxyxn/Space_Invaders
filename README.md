A 'Space Invaders' clone built in Vanilla JS. 

I created this game to implement the Euclidean distance formula.

The game deploys collision detection to check for real-time XYR intersections of circular projectiles and a circle-based enemy.

Controls: <br>
A → Move Left <br>
S → Shoot <br>
D → Move Right <br>
